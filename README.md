# Flawless 3D-PDF Viewer

## Overview

The Flawless 3D-PDF Viewer is an open-source project aimed at creating a web-based viewer for 3D PDF files. The viewer will enable users to interact with 3D content embedded within PDF files that are in the glTF format. This project leverages Mozilla's PDF.js library for PDF rendering and Three.js's glTF loader for 3D content rendering.

The primary goal of this project is to enhance the capabilities of Mozilla PDF.js to include the rendering and interactive manipulation of 3D content within PDF files. In addition to the basic PDF.js features, the viewer will enable the activation of 3D tools when 3D content is detected, allowing users to control and manipulate 3D models.


## Features

The Flawless 3D-PDF Viewer aims to provide the following key features:

1. **3D Content Rendering**: The viewer will be able to render 3D content embedded in PDF files in the glTF format using Three.js.

2. **3D Tools**: When 3D content is active, the viewer will display 3D tools that allow users to interact with and manipulate 3D models.

3. **3D Annotations**: Users will be able to add annotations to 3D content within PDF files, enhancing collaboration and communication.

4. **Measuring**: Measurement tools will be provided for users to measure distances and dimensions within 3D models.

5. **3D Comments**: Users can leave comments on specific 3D elements within the PDF, facilitating discussions and feedback.

6. **Adobe Reader Compatibility**: The viewer will support the import and export of comments in Adobe Reader's format, ensuring compatibility with existing workflows.
